# GOAL
The goal of this project is to decode IR signals emmited from a HITACHI HCRA31NEWH remote control 

# Process
The raw IR codes have been captured using a TSOP38238 together with an inexpensive 8 channel 24MHZ logic analyzer. PulseView has been used for capturing at 24mhz and 10MSA.
The general IR code structure is the following:![General Capture](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dea65f98-c0de-4ebc-9681-aa6ac756878f)
